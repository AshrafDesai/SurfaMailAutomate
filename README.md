# Email Campaign Script for SurfaTech Integrated Solutions

This Python script enables the sending of professional, visually appealing advertising emails to a large number of recipients. It is designed for **SurfaTech Integrated Solutions** to showcase their innovative surface treatment solutions, including powder coating, spray gun sales, and customized services. The email subject is **"Enhance Your Surface Treatment with SurfaTech Integrated Solutions"** and the body of the email contains a beautifully designed HTML layout that highlights the company's key services and offerings. The script supports **HTML email**, which includes images and banners, and allows for easy customization of the subject line, email body, and branding elements. It also provides the ability to send emails to multiple recipients in a single execution, with error handling to notify users of any failed email deliveries. To use this script, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the built-in `smtplib` and `email` libraries. To set up the script, you need to clone or download it to your system and ensure that you've configured a Gmail account with **Less Secure App Access** enabled or an **App Password** generated for security. You will then add your recipient email addresses to the `recipient_list` variable in the script. For usage, you will first update the sender's email information with your own email and app password, customize the subject line and body as needed, and then execute the script by running `python send_email.py` in your Python environment. Upon execution, the script will connect to the SMTP server, send emails to all recipients, and provide success messages for each email sent, along with any errors for failed attempts. Be aware that Gmail has daily sending limits (typically 500 emails per day for personal accounts), so consider using a business email or a service like SendGrid for higher volumes. It's also important to ensure that any external links and images in the email body are accessible online. For security purposes, avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords in production and consider using environment variables. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
